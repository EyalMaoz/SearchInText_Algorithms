# Search In Text Algorithms Comparance.
First lab for the course "Text and Sequences Algorithms"

In this lab we impolemented two algorithm to search in a large text.
One is the Naive algorithm, which basically go over all the text and find the word.
The second one is the "Basic algorithm", learned in our course.

Than, we compare the speeds of both algorithm over all the possible word in size of "sizeS" which is 19.
The resault are amazing ðŸ˜²
